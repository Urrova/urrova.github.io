				<p>Hi guys i'm the Urrova, i didnt die xd.</p>
<p>The website is in reconstruction, cause i got tired from throwing HTML like crazy; i've rebuilt it to use a framework (11ty), for making the pages of the site faster.</p>
<p>Expect things from me! (i'll upload more things i swear).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they ask, why using 11ty and not what the Normals use a.k.a React? Cause i dont have money for a server with backend :(</p>

			<title>Amalgoom was Released!!</title>

<p>One of the Doom community projects I participated in came out literally yesterday.</p>
<p>It's a full game mod (they call it a megawad in Doomworld) that combines every map from Doom and Doom 2 into one. So you have Hangar from Doom + Entryway from Doom II, etc.</p>
<p>I contributed to this mod with four MIDIs, which you can find in the music section of the site.</p>
<p>Do you wanna play the mod? <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/152974-amalgoom-rc2-sandy-petersen-interview-premiere-05172025/">Download it from its Doomworld thread</a></p>
