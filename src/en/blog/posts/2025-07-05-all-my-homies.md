I uploaded a new MIDI I made for Grungo's DOOM project named OUTLAND. After I made it i got burnout AGAIN. Really I need to do stuff OUTSIDE DOOM this time.

I'ts available on the music section! Probably i'll upload it to Youtube then.

EDIT: Uploaded it to youtube, its available from [the post's link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz_9HG9Vcpk).
