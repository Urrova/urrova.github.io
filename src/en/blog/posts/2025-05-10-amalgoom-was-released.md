One of the Doom community projects I participated in came out literally yesterday.

It's a full game mod (they call it a megawad in Doomworld) that combines every map from Doom and Doom 2 into one. So you have Hangar from Doom + Entryway from Doom II, etc.

I contributed to this mod with four MIDIs, which you can find in the music section of the site.

Do you wanna play the mod? [Download it from its Doomworld thread](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/152974-amalgoom-rc2-sandy-petersen-interview-premiere-05172025/)
