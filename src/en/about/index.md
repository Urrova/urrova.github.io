No cuarteto de nos reference for english users lol.

I'm a guy that lives in <span class="text_green text_glitchy">The MATRIX/Rapture/Raccoon city</span> a.k.a. Argentina. Right now i make music, make game mods, and try to live life (unsucessfully).

## VIDEOGAMES
As i see i luve computer gaems. I started playing videogames with shit hardware so i ended being what in my country is named an <span class="text_waving">emulapoor</span>, playing old NES/GBA/N64/MSDOS games. 

Later I discovered the Amazing World of Indie Games, both the Upper Indie Class, like Castle Crashers and 2hu, and the Lower Indie Class, like the random games on itch.io made by random people in their house.

Some of the kinds of games i like to play:
- PROJECT ZOMBOID (luve project zomboid)
- Old FPS games (DOOM; Quake; Half-Life) and their indie resurrection (DUSK; ULTRAKILL).
- Rythm games (osu!; Taiko no Tatsujin; JSAB; Geometry Dash) 
- Shoot em ups, going to bullet hell (Touhou Project, Eschatos, Ikaruga). 
- Maze platformers aka "metroidvanya" (Symphony of the Night, Hollow Knight & Silksong, Touhou Luna Nights)
- <span class="text_stoned">c o o k e d  simulators</span> (stroke games like LSD Dream Emulator)
- Recently started playing coops (like R.E.P.O. and Peak)


## GAMEDEV
Before i liked to program videgames, but i never finished any and when i finished anything nobody cared, so i went make doom mods, and then i burned out. Now i dont have motivation or time or ideas to make a videogame.

I hope sometime i can make a videogame again... i try to be optimistic about this.

## MUSIC
I make music, dragging squares and drawing forms and rotationg knobs in computer programs.
I make rock and electronic music, sometimes stand alone and sometimes as a soundtrack for a bigger project. Sometimes i make MIDIs for collab doom projects. (NEGATIVEONE; Alamgoom; Outland).

Some music i like:

- Cuarteto de Nos
- Dream Theater; Symphony X; Michael Romeo; King Crimson; TesseracT and other prog rock/metal bands.
- Calle 13
- Camellia; Xtrullor; PERTURBATOR; Carpenter Brut and other heavy electronic music.
- Dragonforce; Stratovarius and other power metal bands.
- Videogame music (Touhou, Hotline Miami, etc)

## DOOM MODS
I made too many doom mods. Community is great and makes mods that looks like completely different games and <span class="text_red">GZDoom</span> making doom look like a second roblox, being Ancient Aliens my favourite mod.

IMPSCAPE WAS AN EXCESS, i'm pretty much ashamed of it. Don't take too seriously and life or death making mods for a game, don't put 2 years or something to your wad, you don't need to make the 32 maps megawad with 25000 ZScript lines to being valued. If you want to do a doom masterpiece, don't go alone. Don't be like me and join community projects. Masterpieces are done by groups of many people.

Althrought Doom has been very important on my life because the community, etc, unfortunately i'm no longer interested on it.
