This is a Community Project started by Johnny Cruelty/Grungo and continued by DoomGappy.

Its a boom compatible megawad that mixes the original Doom and Doom II levels. Each map also has its own remixed song based on the original MIDIs of each map.
I collaborated to this project with 4 MIDI songs (2 main and 2 B-Sides)
