You just infiltrated an enemy base to find out where so many demons came from, and you discover a portal. You decided to enter the portal and it took you to a surprising place: Another dimension, where demons are produced to fight allies with enemies. Can you defeat the one who controls the dimension and then destroy the dimension?

This wad is a non-terry version of SIGTAGNY.wad, which originally had terry traps, screamers and shit. I grabbed it and made my own version of SIGTAGNY.wad, which is this pk3.
