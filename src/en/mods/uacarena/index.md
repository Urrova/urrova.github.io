UAC Arena is a wave survival game based on DooM 2. Basically the Arena is a room with 4 doors and every time more and more enemies are spawned and more quality. There is also a teleporter in the middle of the map where resources such as medikits or mega spheres are spawned.

Strong enemies are generated from the following rounds:

::: block

- Revenant - Round 5
- Mancubus - Round 10
- Pain Elemental - Round 15
- Cyberdemon - Round 20
- Spider MasterMind - Round 30

:::

Obviously, at higher rounds, it becomes NUTS.WAD xD.

Additional credits:
The sky of fire of the PSX version: Scalliano / Fenderc01

If you want you can look, modify and publish modified copies of the wad, with the condition of putting me in the credits.
