someone kill me lol{.text_red}

A new demon base was installed on earth, and you must steal the invasion data to counter the attacks, however you realize the FURDEMON's true plan, quite strange: to turn all the inhabitants of the planet into a kind of "furries" to attack other planets. You must destroy FURDEMON as soon as possible!

This is my first single player wad, I hope you enjoy it!

Recommendations: You should be able to jump and duck You should be able to freelook, since it's easier to fly You should play it with hardware renderer (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc), since it has dynamic lights, brightmaps, sprite rotations, etc.
