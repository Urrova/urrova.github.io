This is a collaborative boom-compatible 34 maps megawad where I participated, originally started by AtticTelephone

That was called a "Social Experiment", where anybody can edit that wad and release the version, and after that another person can edit.
The wad was an exit, but was released with bugs, so i make a bugfix thread for the people that wants to polish more the wad.
