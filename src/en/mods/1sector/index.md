This is a Community Project managed by iddq tea.

Its a boom compatible megawad thats made by maps with only 1 sector, that means only 1 floor and 1 ceiling.

I made MAP17, a map that is a giant scrolling sector.

This is my last doom map. Unfortunately my Doom phase ended long ago, so im not going to doom until a looooong time.
